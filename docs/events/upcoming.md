## May 2019: Lightning Talks

This time weâ€™ll show you the diversity of the Vue Ecosystem! The format is Lightning Talks: five talks of 15 minutes each.

We encourage first time and seasoned speakers to speak at this event. As organisers we support you as mentors to prepare the topic and the slides. Please contact us via [Twitter or email](../about/contact.md).
