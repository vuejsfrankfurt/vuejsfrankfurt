## September 26 2019: Mobile Vue.js â€“ From PWA to Native

Building applications for mobile devices has its additional challenges: The network connection can be flaky and slow, so the application should still work when the device is offline. Users expect application icons on their home screens to start them. Depending on your use cases you want to access sensors that are not available in the browser.

This Meetup [Martin Sotirov](https://twitter.com/unclemartycodes) will talk about Vue on mobile devices and take a look at the different ways you can deploy a Vue app on mobile. We start with a PWA, go through a hybrid solution using Ionic Capacitor and then finally arrive at a NativeScript app which renders native iOS and Android views.

**When?** Thursday, September 26 @ 18:00-21:00</br>
**Where?** [AOE GmbH - Frankfurt](./locations.html#aoe-gmbh-frankfurt)
