## December 9 2019: Robust Design Systems with Storybook and Vue.js

It seems that everyone is talking about design systems these days, but what is that anyway? In this hands-on talk, Andreas will talk about the foundations of a design system and how implementing one in your organization will help bridge the gap between design and development teams. From introducing tooling like Storybook to crafting a robust process applicable in almost every project, youâ€™ll learn about the ins and outs of design systems.

**Wann?** Montag, 9. Dezember @ 19:30-21:00</br>
