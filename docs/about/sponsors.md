## Become a sponsor or supporter!

You'd like to support Vue.js Frankfurt? We're looking forward to your message either [directly](./contact.md) or via one of our [team members](./team.md).

* **Speakers:** We are always looking for speakers for our events. Whether you'd like to give a talk or know someone who would be interested in giving a talk, we would love to hear from you. We also welcome topic and event requests and ideas!
* **Locations:** Finding event locations can be hard, which is why we depend on the community to help us find offices, meeting rooms or coworking spaces where we can host our events. We are also open for more creative spots, so maybe you know a museum or restaurant that could host us? If you know someone or have any contacts, we'd love to hear from you.
* **Catering:** Do you know a great caterer or want to make something yourself for one (or more) of our events? Reach out to us (samples welcome :wink:)!
* **Organisational support:** Organising a community can be a lot of work, which is why we always welcome anyone who would like to take a more active role in our commiunity. This can be assisting with various things, including event preparation, organising, welcoming guests at events, decorating and so much more. There is always something we need help with! :slightly_smiling_face:
