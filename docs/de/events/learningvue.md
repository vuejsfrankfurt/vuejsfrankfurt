At our kick-off we met a lot of Vue.js enthusiasts with various levels of Vue.js experience. Some had no or very little experience. There are many free online resources to learn Vue.js, but this might not be the right choice for everyone. 

Starting from February 20th we're introduce you to Vue Basics, Vue CLI, Remote APIs and Unit Testing.
This time we'll give the training in <del>German</del> English again! Registrations are now open!

## Happy faces after two intense hours!

Our first training on November 9th 2018 was a success - 100% of all registrants came!
This helped a lot to organise the event, choose the right room and prepare for the training.

We had two very intense training hours: learning the Vue.js basics, how to use the developer tools,
avoiding pitfalls in day-to-day work. Thank you for [msg](./locations.md#msg-systems-ag) to provide
location and drinks!
