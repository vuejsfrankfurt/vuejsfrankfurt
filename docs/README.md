# Welcome to Vue.js Frankfurt :tada:

Vue.js Frankfurt is a meetup community for anyone interested Vue.js. Join us at one of our events to get to know our community. We hope to see you around!

This website is made with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org). You can [find the repo on GitHub](https://github.com/vuejsfrankfurt/vuejsfrankfurt.de) and contribute with translations, add content, learn how to work with VuePress and lots more. We hope to get lots of help with the website!
